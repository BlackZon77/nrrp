Hello dear community,

here I have created a revised version of the Exteriour of Mission Row PD and made it available for download. 
This is a YMAP that is ready for FiveM. A small installation guide follows in the description below. 
You are not allowed to redistribute this version(s) or publish it on other platforms or GTA5 mods. 
An introduction in a video is of course allowed. But please mention me! :-)

With kind regards
MG11

Installation Tutorial for FiveM:

1. download the map (in the form of the folder)
2. drag it to your server in the "resources" folder.
3. put "start MRPDUpgrade" in the server.cfg

Done!
